Welcome. This site is currently just a launchpad to other places.

## Quick Links

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahimnal/) will usually have the latest updates when it comes to any professional pursuits and my career.

This [Portfolio](https://mahim.myportfolio.com/) contains my photography and video projects and will be updated with some prior and nearly all future projects. I do have an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mahim.jpeg/), but it's not as much of a priority as the portfolio.

## What I'm Working On

I'm focusing on further establishing myself as a software engineer, while honing my craft with photo and video works.

With **software engineering**, my main strength lies in the ability to pinpoint problems regardless of the tool or language. Much of my experience is specifically in JavaScript and .NET, with a focus on front-end UI and APIs. This includes designing complex components in Angular, building scalable web APIs with .NET and troubleshooting/maintaining said components and APIs.

With **photography and videography**, I'm mainly driven to get a little better with everything I do, and take projects that excite or inspire me. I don't have a formal business at the moment, but I will occasionally take clients. I'm more experienced with taking photos then videos currently, and I consider myself relatively proficient with the core Adobe suite (Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere).

## About & Contact

Beyond engineering and creative media pursuits, I'm continually trying to live in the image of **Christ**. I enjoy good stories, breaking complex topics down into simple pieces for others and pushing my limits (literally) with long-distance running.

The best way to contact me professionally will always be **LinkedIn**. If you're a client interested in photos or videos, or looking to collaborate on a creative project, you can reach me via the **Contact page on my Portfolio** or at my aforementioned **Instagram**.
